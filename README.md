# deredactie.be Videozone for Kodi

Kodi plugin to watch videos from deredactie.be.

**As of June 2017, this plugin does not work anymore.** The Atom feeds produced
by deredactie.be no longer contain the URLs to the HTTP Live Streaming manifests
that the plugin uses. Although I get the feeling that the Videozone will be
phased out entirely in favor of VRT NU, I will gladly accept pull requests that
resolve this issue.

## Installation

Go to _Settings_ &rarr; _Add-ons_ &rarr; _Get Add-ons_ &rarr; _Kodi Add-on
Repository_ &rarr; _Video Add-ons_ and find _deredactie.be Videozone_ in the
list. Of course, you can also use the search feature.

Alternatively, you can also grab a zip file of this repository and install that.
